		BACKING BEANS / SPRING BEANS ARE DECLARED HERE, i.e. classes to be used thru the spring flow(s).
		
		SERVICE DEFINITIONS ARE DECLARED HERE, defines Service Id ex.: BUKAORTA, message bundle ex.: messages/bukaorta/BukAortaMessages and corresponding service ex.: elvisBookingService
		
		Each serviceDefinition should have a corresponding lookupService.
		The look up services are responsible for doing a "lookup" on each user that tries to log on to pick the correct Service Definition and its content that user should have
		
		Each differentiating WebService should have a corresponding mapper class which converts WS specific classes into our own domain objects.
		For example an Elvis Booking object is different from a Sectra RIS Booking class but both are converted by mapper classes into a Booking object defined in this application.
		That Booking object in turn is then used through out our application.
